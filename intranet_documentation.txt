This project implements the following conventions:
    - Classes follow common naming conventions.
    - Methods and variables are names using snake-case, fully lowercase.

Moreover, the 'intranet__user' file defines the 'User' class which contains the algorithm for
password encryption. This algorithm makes use of the user's plaintext password - P - to
extract the sum of all its contained digits - n - (at least one is required for a valid password),
sums this value - i - with the length of the password plaintext - k -, elevates n to the power i,
and concatenates this value - e - to the password string.

That is, the encrypted password, C, is equal to

    P

the plaintext password, concatenated with

    e

which,

    e = n^(i)

where, as described above, n is equal to the sum of all the integers of P, with k as P's length, and

    i = n + k

Thus, the encrypted password is

    C = P + str(e)

                               QED

In order to exemplify the password encryption, we show the pseudocode describing this process:

    P = new_password
    C = ""
    e = 0
    k = len(new_password)

    n = 0
    m = find_all(int, new_password)
    for integer in n:
        n += integer

    i = n + k

    e = power(n, i)

    C = P + str(e)

This creates a new string composed of the original password and its new relatively complex component, with
e as its encryption key.
